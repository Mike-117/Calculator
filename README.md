# Calculator
 
The calculator is a fairly straightforward program using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The calculator screen is basically an array of HTML buttons, styled with CSS. The buttons stand for numbers and operators, and the result display. There is an equal button, a decimal point button, and an all-clear button as well.

The Javascript takes a number from the user, then an operator, then another number, and displays the result, in the same order as a normal calculator. There can be multiple inputs and multiple operations, each perform in the input order. The data is processed like a calculator and not an adding machine.
